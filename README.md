# Super-Link-Bro
Based on the original Super Mario Bros, this game welcomes the beloved character of Link into Mario's world. On either side of the player, they'll be able to explore the terrain as it is randomly generated to earn points. However, watch out for any Tektites or Stalfos! They'll randomly spawn and try to hurt Link as he explores the world. Defeat these enemies with arrows or bombs acquired from item blocks to gain additional points. 

To run the project, simply used "cmd + b" or click the arrow button on the top-right corner when opening the file titled "main.py" in VSCode. No additional libraries (other than cmu_graphics) is required to run the game!

Shortcut commands include pressing "m" to implement the movement boost and "j" to implement the jump boost for Link.Do remember that Link can be moved through the "wasd" keys and shoots arrows and bombs (when acquired) through the keys "p" and "o", respectively.
